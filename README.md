## A Geometry Dash Recreation for Reinforcement Learning

This project is a simple recreation of the popular rhythm-based platformer, Geometry Dash. The primary goal of this project is to train a reinforcement learning (RL) based AI to play the game from scratch.

### The Game

The game is a simple 2D platformer where the player controls a square that moves automatically from left to right. The player can only jump to avoid obstacles, such as spikes and walls. The goal is to reach the end of the level without crashing into any obstacles.

### The AI

The main objective of this project is to train an AI to play the game using reinforcement learning. The AI will learn to play the game by trial and error, receiving rewards for progressing through the level and penalties for crashing. The AI will be trained from scratch, without any prior knowledge of the game.

### Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed. You can then clone the repository and run the game using the following command:

```bash
python -m vertex_velocity.game -l <path_to_level_file>
```

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- Ward for testing

### Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
